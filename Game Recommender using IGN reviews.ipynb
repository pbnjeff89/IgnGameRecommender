    "\n",
    "There's a bit of thinking to do here, as the incorrect parameters may give extremely strange recommendations. Here are a few things that I can think of to improve the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exclude infrequent corpus-specific words\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate this, consider RPGs where you might number your series as 1, 2, 3, etc., or I, II, III, etc. Some of these should already be filtered out for having a sufficiently low letter count (e.g. I and II), but \"words\" like \"III\"  can be considered a word, and will be used to find cosine similarity if you're not careful. This would help to prevent cosine similarity build-up between games like Warcraft III and Diablo III *on the basis of the word \"III.\"* (N.b. that there are other good reasons why Warcraft III and Diablo III ought to have a cosine similarity).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Play around with stemming and/or lemmatizing\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, this would be very helpful in reviews, as there tend to be variations of words. One simple example would be the word \"gun.\" If there were no stemming or lemmatizing, \"gun\" and \"guns\" would be considered orthogonal features. We (humans) know that those two words are obviously related, so it would be nice if they would be considered to be part of the same vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Play around with min/max document frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "There's not a real good way (as far as I know) to explore the parameter space of this well except by hand. In general, typical stop words like \"a,\" \"or,\" \"the,\" etc. have a high document frequency, so setting the ```max_df``` parameter to about ```0.7``` will likely filter out most stop words.\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing reviews, one could imagine that there are words commonly used. Perhaps these words will not be as numerous as the stop words mentioned in the previous paragraph, but certainly they can constitute a significant portion of the text which could ultimately result in cosine similarity between other games. For example, having a storyline with engaging characters can be a common topic to discuss in a review. Maybe one reviewer considers that characters in one of the Halo games to be super engaging, and another reviewer states the same thing, but for a character in one of the Dragon Quest games.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we toe a fine line because maybe you would actually like to see other games that have engaging characters, but you also only like RPGs, so if you liked a game from the Dragon Quest series, it would be strange to see a suggestion for one of the Halo games.\n",

    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "I had to establish a narrow band of document frequencies to search over because otherwise there would be cosine similarities between games that were superficially related. For example, the game Warcraft III could easily be matched with other games that contained the Roman numeral III in it, like Close Combat III, Caesar III, etc. While some of them could be verified to be related for a good reason, this would be an example of a recommendation that isn't entirely accurate because the algorithm result implies that games that contain III are all related somehow.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not, and for what I think are obvious reasons. Patterns like that are not terribly common, thankfully, so it's a matter of adjusting the ```min_df``` parameter to hopefully ensure that there are more common themes that are considered. On the other hand, because reviews would tend to use phrases like \"this game was exciting\" or \"the storyline was moving\" or something similar, there may be some words that exist in a wide variety of documents, and so the document frequency must be below a certain number; otherwise, if a review states that \"Doki Doki Literature Club has an emotionally charged storyline\" and another review states that \"the storyline of Puzzles & Dragons is non-existent,\" then there is some component in word space that provides a non-zero cosine similarity. For those familiar with those games, I think it should be obvious why there shouldn't be any cosine similarity. Or, perhaps you disagree with those statements. I don't know. I also just made up those reviews and don't really have an opinion on those statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, I believe that the recommendations given by the algorithm that uses game reviews are far superior to the ones that do not use the reviews. I this is easily seen by looking at the recommendations above. Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is a a FPS, meaning that it's a game that involves guns and is played from the first-person perspective. You'd expect that games that have similar elements would be recommended, and indeed they have been:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Halo 3\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hitman\n",
    "\n",
    "* Skyrim\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gunpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "Gunpoint is actually described as a stealth-based game, which is actually consistent with the kind of game that Deus Ex is. Skyrim is too, for that matter, if you're into pickpocketing and using the stealth archer meme build. These types of themes would not have been found just by stringing together the title, genre, and platform metadata. Without looking for specific passages in the reviews, you could guess that the guns, stealth, and first-person perspective were some non-negligible portion of the review in some or all of the recommended reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without the reviews, Deus Ex was given some pretty strange recommendations. The only one of those games that I would think are even remotely related to Deus Ex would be Dark Souls (coincidentally, the first one recommended), but everything else seems completely out of the blue. The other recommended games tend to be turn-based RPGs set in more fantastical settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, the recommendations with reviews are, again, far superior to the recommendations without reviews. What I found was that the games recommended tended to be games that were \"real-time strategy\" or \"turn-based strategy.\" Warcraft III, of course, doesn't have anything turn-based (not counting custom games on Battle.net), but I think the key theme here is \"strategy.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Without the reviews, Warcraft III gets recommendations like Railroad Tycoon and Kagero. Railroad Tycoon definitely does not match with the type of game Warcraft III is, and Kagero is a game where you run around and set traps to defeat your enemies. There are other games like Populous and other wargame simulators which are at least a bit more relevant; their matches could probably be attributed to matches in the genre field."
